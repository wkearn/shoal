# shoal: an array programming language for sonar data analysis

shoal is a scripting language developed for [sdw](https://github.com/wkearn/sdw). It aims to provide a minimal programming environment within which sophisticated analysis algorithms can be developed and applied to sidescan sonar data that is managed through sdw. Unless you are using sdw, you probably won't find shoal very useful. However, if you are still interested, you can check out the [dev branch](https://github.com/wkearn/shoal/tree/dev) for the latest updates.

## Features

- Built-in immutable arrays
- Array processing via higher-order functions (map, reduce, scan, etc.)
- Fully parenthesized prefix notation
- Polymorphism via Hindley-Milner-style type inference
- Parametric overloading for built-in mathematical functions
